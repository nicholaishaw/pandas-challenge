# School Performance Analysis Using Pandas

In a fictional universe, I am the new Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. In this capacity, I will be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

For my first project, I have been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I have be given access to every student's math and reading scores on a recent competency assessment, as well as various information on the schools they attend. These data were given to me in two csv files. The first file ('starter-students-complete.csv') is a dataset that contains the names of every student, their ids, gender, grade, school they attended, reading score, and their math score. The second ('starter-schools-complete.csv') provides information on each schoolâ€”the name of the school, school id, the school type (i.e., district or charter), size, and budget. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
